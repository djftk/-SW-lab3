# **My Project Plan(Levle 1 Heading)**
***note:*** This is written as an illustrative example, and does not provide ant working guide to an actual project.
### **Proposal (Level 3 Heading)**
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software taht detects objects in images. 
In oreder to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](http://) or [PyTorch](http://), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were dectected using [mmdetection](http://):

### **Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)**
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manner

### **Installation**
In a bash terminal, run the following commands *(DO NOT actually ru these commands in your computer):*
```sh
$ sudo apt upate
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda active cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
